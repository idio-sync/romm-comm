# RomM-ComM (RomM Communicator Module)

A Discord bot that integrates with the [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) API to provide information about your ROM collection and conrol RomM from Discord.

## Features

Current
- Recently Added: Posts recently added ROM updates in specified channel
- Stats: Near real-time ROM collection statistics in voice channel, bot status and via command
- Search: Platform-specific ROM searches and random ROM roll that provide download link and game/file information
- Search: Support for multi-file games - user can select one, some or all files to download
- Search: Platform based firmware search that lists firmware file information and provides download links
- Scans: Start/stop different types of RomM scans, report back with info about the scan when complete and also during a scan in progress via command
- Request System: Make and manage ROM requests entirely in Discord, now enriched with IGDB metadata
- Emojis: Custom game console emoji uploads upon bot installation, use of said emojis in bot responses and stats
- Emojis: Bot checks for Nitro on the server and if found uploads extended list of emojis, if the bot detects Nitro removed it deverts back to the standard list
- QR code generation: Install games on 3DS/Vita via QR code with apps like FBI/[FBI Reloaded](https://github.com/TheRealZora/FBI-Reloaded)/[VitaShell](https://github.com/RealYoti/VitaShell) (download endpoint auth must be disabled on RomM instance)
- RomM User Management: Manage users, automatically create RomM account for users with specific role and remove RomM accont upon role removal
- Switch Shop Info: Command that lists instructions on how to connect to the [Tinfoil](https://tinfoil.io/Download) endpoint of connected RomM server (download endpoint auth must be disabled on RomM instance)
- Rate-limited Discord API interactions
- Caching system, the bot onnly fetches fresh stats if that particular stat has updated since last fetch

Planned
- Alternative chat client integrations (Matrix, Telegram, Slack), no eta for now

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Pycord library
- aiohttp
- python-dotenv
- qrcode
- Pillow
- python-socketio
- requests
- aiosqlite

## Installation

Docker:
1. `docker pull idiosync000/romm-comm:latest`
2. Pass env variables as shown below
3. Pass `/app/data` in the container to host directory, this is where the request DB and emoji sync status are stored

Non-Docker:
1. Clone the repository or download the source code
2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install py-cord aiohttp python-dotenv qrcode Pillow python-socketio requests aiosqlite
```
## Discord Bot Token Creation
- See https://docs.pycord.dev/en/stable/discord.html
- Enable "privileged gateway intents" in the bot settings

## RomM Settings

If you want browser downloads to function for users without logging in and Switch shop/Qr code downloads to function on consoles, set Add `DISABLE_DOWNLOAD_ENDPOINT_AUTH=true` to your RomM environment variables. Without this setting disabled, the user clicking the download link will have to have a RomM account and log in before downloading.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env

### Configuration Details

#### Required Settings:

## Recently Added ROM Notifications
- If enabled (`RECENT_ROMS_ENABLED=true`) the bot will post recently added roms to a specified channel
- When multiple roms are added, the bot creates a bached responce listing what was added by platform
- If a large amount of roms are added, flood control is tripped and messages are supressed
- Thresholds for max listed ROMs and flood protection adjustable as an env variable 
- NOTE: I would only enable this on installations where most of the roms are already scanned in. Large imports that run multiple hours may cause issues, I have not had the opprotunity to test.

## Visable Statistics

Voice Channel Stat Display
- If enabled (`UPDATE_VOICE_NAMES=true`), the bot creates voice channels displaying platform, rom, save, savestate, screenshot and RomM user count as well as RomM storage use size
- Only updates if stats change upon API refresh
- Creates new channels and deletes the old to guarantee no duplicate channels

Bot "Now Playing" ROM count
- Lists number of ROMs as the bot's status
- Updates whenever API data is refreshed via timer or manually

## Emojis

Automatic Emoji management. Provides:
- Upon first boot or joining Discord server (if bot booted before joining) a list of 50 custom emojis is grabbed and uploaded to the server
- Emojis appear automatically next to platform names across bot responses if matching emoji is on the server
- Nitro awareness - bot can detect if Nitro is present on the server and if found uploads extended list of emojis (mostly more obscure consoles and variants)
- If the bot detects Nitro is removed it reverts back to the standard list of 50, so none of the more commonly used emojis are deleted when the limit decreases

![RrequestFulfulledDM](.github/screenshots/RequestFulfilledDM.png)

Request System Features:
- Users can submit ROM requests with platform, game name, and optional details as text
- Searches for existing ROM names in the RomM database to see if there is already a ROM present with the requested game name to avoid unnecessary requests
- Matches request with IGDB entry if possible, if IGDB match is not found user can still submit "Platform, Game" request
- Limit of 5 pending requests per user, so requests do not get overwhelming
- DM notifications to users when their requests are fulfilled/rejected either automatically after a RomM system scan or manually via admin
- Users can view their own requests
- Users can cancel their pending requests
- Uses SQLite database to store requests
- Request system is toggleable via env variable if server admin does not want to use it

Admin Features:
- List all pending requests with game and requester info
- Fulfill or reject requests
- Add notes to requests

Dababase Structure:
- Request ID
- User information
- Platform and game details
- Request status (pending/fulfilled/rejected/cancelled)
- Timestamps
- Admin notes and fulfillment details

### User Manager
- /sync_users - Sync all users who have auto-register role (Admin only)

General:
- User Manager is togglable by server admin, if `ENABLE_USER_MANAGER` is set to `FALSE` the module will avoid being loaded entirely and no commands will show in Discord

Account Creation:
- Creates RomM account when role specified in `AUTO_REGISTER_ROLE_ID` is assigned to Discord user
- Uses Discord display name for RomM username (_1/2/3 etc. if dupe)
- Handles existing accounts, asks user if they have a RomM account and promps them to link accounts before creating new account
- Always creates new accounts as regular users with 'viewer' permissions in RomM
- Generates random password and notifies new user by DM, gives RomM domain info and instructs them to log in and change password
- Preserves existing admin accounts
- Adds warning notifications for admin account links

Role Removal:
- Deletes RomM user account when role is removed from Discord user
- Sends DM notification
- Logs deletion
- Only affects users created by the bot
- Checks if user is admin before deletion
- Preserves admin accounts even if role is removed
- Logs attempted deletions of admin accounts
- Notifies server admins of protection

## Error Handling

The bot includes comprehensive error handling and logging:
- API connection issues
- Rate limit management
- Discord API errors
- Data validation
- Cache management

## Security

- OAuth2 bearer tokens for API requests using http
- Environment variable configuration instead of storing passwors in code
- No sensitive data logging (passwords, etc)
- Proper permission checking

## Troubleshooting

- Check Discord bot token
- Verify bot permissions on Discord's end
- Check API connectivity to RomM
- Check logs for error messages, I tried to meticulously report errors
- Verify configuration settings in the env
